         * DESCRIPTION: The routine takes a pitchShift factor value which is between 0.5
         * (one octave down) and 2. (one octave up). A value of exactly 1 does not change
         * the pitch. numSampsToProcess tells the routine how many samples in indata[0...
         * numSampsToProcess-1] should be pitch shifted and moved to outdata[0 ...
         * numSampsToProcess-1]. The two buffers can be identical (ie. it can process the
         * data in-place). fftFrameSize defines the FFT frame size used for the
         * processing. Typical values are 1024, 2048 and 4096. It may be any value <=
         * MAX_FRAME_LENGTH but it MUST be a power of 2. osamp is the STFT
         * oversampling factor which also determines the overlap between adjacent STFT
         * frames. It should at least be 4 for moderate scaling ratios. A value of 32 is
         * recommended for best quality. sampleRate takes the sample rate for the signal
         * in unit Hz, ie. 44100 for 44.1 kHz audio. The data passed to the routine in
         * indata[] should be in the range [-1.0, 1.0), which is also the output range
         * for the data, make sure you scale the data accordingly (for 16bit signed integers
         * you would have to divide (and multiply) by 32768)
