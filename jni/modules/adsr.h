/**
 * ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain and Release) provides amplitude
 * envelopes to a BaseSynthEvents signal
 *
 * Attack time is the time taken for initial run-up of level from nil to peak, beginning when the key is first pressed.
 * Decay time is the time taken for the subsequent run down from the attack level to the designated sustain level.
 * Sustain level is the level during the main sequence of the sound's duration, until the key is released.
 * Release time is the time taken for the level to decay from the sustain level to zero after the key is released.
 * All time values are in seconds, sustain level is in 0 - 1 range
 *
 * TODO:
 * it might be nice to have non-linear envelope functions too !
